Question:
Write a function findMostFrequent that takes an array and returns the element that appears the most times. If there are multiple elements with the same highest frequency, return any one of them.
const arr = [1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 3, 2];

const result = findMostFrequent(arr);
console.log(result);
// Output: 1 or 3 (since both appear 3 times)
